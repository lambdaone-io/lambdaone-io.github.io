We are starting a training series for those who want to learn functional programming from zero up to a professional level!

## The Training:

Every session contains:

* A clear explanation of WHY the topic is given and HOW it is useful
* Topic explanations are kept clear, to the point and as simple as possible
* Plenty of programming repetition exercises are provided
* Plenty of Feynmanâ€™s technique exercises are provided
* Social interaction is encouraged

## Session Topics:

### Expressions

Outcome:
* Understand what mathematical expressions are
* Understand what syntax rules of expressions are
* Know what type of expressions there are
* What is the relation between computer programs and mathematical expressions
* What is the advantage of using mathematical expressions to write programs

### Evaluation, Substitution and Equality

Outcome:
* Understand expressions as a denotation of a value
* Understand evaluation as the semantics of the expression
* What equality is, considering evaluation
* Understand substitution
* What equality is considering substitution
