These are the slides and video for the [Workshop: Dependency Injection in Typed FP](https://www.meetup.com/lambda1-fp-academy-ams/events/257583605/)

Dependency Injection (DI) are techniques used to manage the insertion of modules or context into our programs for configuration or separation of concerns. We will review techniques used in functional programming: function arguments, type classes and the Reader monad, and how they compare with traditional OOP. Once more, join for great profit!
