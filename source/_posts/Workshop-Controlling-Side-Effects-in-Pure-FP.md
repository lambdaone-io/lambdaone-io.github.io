These are the slides and video for the [Workshop: Controlling Side Effects in Pure FP](https://www.meetup.com/lambda1-fp-academy-ams/events/257280105/)

"Side effects in functions are a problem"

Functional programmers are always buzzing about purity, but how are we even able to do any computation at all without side effects? On this workshop, we will learn the smart solution given by the FP community and also learn how to apply it with cats-effect!
